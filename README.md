## Description ##
This is an app for Android 4.0+ that allows you to order food from a restaurant (mostly for cafeterias) and then collect your food (when notified) through a system of verification methods etc... It is built mainly for use by business-people and students who need to order food for later but need to work or they can't get to order as lines are too long.
